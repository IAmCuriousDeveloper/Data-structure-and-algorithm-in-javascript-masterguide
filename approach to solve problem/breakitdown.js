//lets type the skeleton of the function
//function takes the string as the parameter
function charCount(str){

}

function charCount(str){
   //make object to return in the end
   //loop over the string
   //if the char is a number/letter in the object as the key add 1 to the value 
   //elseif add that char to the object and assign 1 as the value 
   //else if char is anything other dont do anything
   //return our object as the result
    }
    //its very necessary that you write these steps it helps you make you problem easier and also make an impact on your interviewer that you are doing something
