# Data-structure-and-algorithm-in-javascript-masterguide
This Repository  contains the information about data structures and algorithms in a very comprehensive way (i.e theory and practical).

since its a datastructure and algorithm course you can start learning from wherever you want. but as we progress there is a learning path from scratch which i recommend you to follow. which described below step by step

1.big-O notation.
1.1 my introduction(optional)
1.2 lets talk about big-O(Time complexity)
1.3 Space complexity

2.Performance of array and objects 
3.approach to solve a problem
4.problem solving patterns.
5.Recursion.
