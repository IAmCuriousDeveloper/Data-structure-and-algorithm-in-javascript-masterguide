Now You have read Problem solving approach . now its time to see some common patterns to solve problems 

some common patterns are.
1.Frequency Counter
2.Multiple Pointers
3.Sliding Window
4.Divide and Conquer
5.Dynamic Programming
6.Greedy Algorithms
7.Backtracking etc.

we will clear some of them here but in the near future i will make sure to add as much as i can 

now lets jump into frequency counter pattern in Frequencycounter.js

make sure you understand the Frequencounter problem now jump into Anagram.js
(falls into the same Frequencounter catagory)

2.time to jump into next catagory (Multiple Pointers)
go to MultiplePointers.js
