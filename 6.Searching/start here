Objectives->
1.Describe what a searching algorithm is
2.Implement linear search on arrays
3.Implement binary search on sorted arrays
4.Implement a naive string searching algorithm

How do we search?
->Given an array, the simplest way to search for an value is to look at every element in the array and check if it's the value we want.

JavaScript has search!
There are many different search methods on arrays in JavaScript:

indexOf
includes
find
findIndex
But how do these functions work?

ex-> lets see linear search.
at linearsearch.js

now that you are familiar with the linear search now its time to see binary search 

go to binarysearch.js

now lets do one exercise
naivesearch.js
now that you know the naive search lets jump into the kmp solution
kmp.js
