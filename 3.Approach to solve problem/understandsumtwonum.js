//understanding a problem
/* 
1.Can I restate the problem in my own words?
ans-> yes implement addition
2.What are the inputs that go into the problem?
and-> can be integer
can be float
can be very large number which ultimately tends to infinity
can be single number (if it always two?)

3.What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
can be output be determined from inputs 
can be null,undefined,or something else

4.Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
most of the case yes but sometimes varied
5.How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

thats it in this part there is no coding continue reading
