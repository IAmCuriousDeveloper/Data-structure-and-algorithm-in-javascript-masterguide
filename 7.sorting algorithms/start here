lets discuss this first what is sorting?
Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.

Examples
Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
Sorting names alphabetically
Sorting movies based on release year
Sorting movies based on revenue

Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works
There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages
Sorting sometimes has quirks, so it's good to understand how to navigate them

javascript has the sort method but it does not works the way u think for Examples

[ "Prashant", "Rawal", "Data Structures", "Algorithms" ].sort();
// [ "Algorithms","Data Structures", "Prashant","Rawal"]; //this works great for the alphabets

[ 6, 4, 15, 10 ].sort();
// [ 10, 15, 4, 6 ] now look what happens it gets mad when we use numbers


now lets see what javascript sort function works

go to javascriptsort.js

Many sorting algorithms involve some type of swapping functionality (e.g. swapping to numbers to put them in order

go to swap.js to learn swaping


In this section i will walk you through various sorting algorithms 
lets start with bubble sorting

go to bubblesort.js
there is one optimized bubblesort file do check it out.it will be good for the interview

now check selectionsort.js

time for the insertionsort.js

now lets see some more challenging sorting algorithms (also the widely used sorting algorithm coz they scale well)

go to mergesort.js
