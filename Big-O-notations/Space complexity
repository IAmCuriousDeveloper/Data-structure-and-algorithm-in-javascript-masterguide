So far, we've been focusing on time complexity: how can we analyze the runtime of an algorithm as the size of the inputs increases?

so what is space complexity?
easy definition -> the space required by your program to compile or run is called space complexity.
or
We can also use big O notation to analyze space complexity: how much additional memory do we need to allocate in order to run the code in our algorithm?

 actually there are two types of space complexity 
 1.with inputs 
 2.without inputs (auxillary space complexity)

Thumb of rules to define space complexity
1.Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
2.Strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length)
3.Reference types are generally O( n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects).

now go and check out the example spacesum.js
again go and check the doublespace.js

thats it for this section i will continue with the next section
